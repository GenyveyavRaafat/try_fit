TryFit is a culturally aware AI-powered virtual try-on system designed for modest fashion and hijab support.
It allows users to try on clothes virtually by combining LaDI-VTON, CLIP, and latent diffusion models, with special support for Egyptian brands.
The system is built with FlutterFlow, Firebase, and a Flask-based API for AI inference.
